### Notes for 21st of April
Seems mighty competent for needing math tutoring, but remain humble and curious!

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

Pretty darn good with graphs and translations, odd and even graphs, applications
to quadratics needed a bit of guidance.

Overall, had not enough to talk about this session! Remain curious.

x^2-x^2 = x^2 - x^2

Don't divide by 0.
