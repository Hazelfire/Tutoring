# Aidan Stynes' tutoring Home page

Year 11 Methods.

Interested in math for Medicine and Sport Sciences! Requires a lot of math.

Last tutoring session: 2nd of June 4:00pm - 5:00pm

Next tutoring session: 9nd of June 4:00pm - 5:00pm

Charity: Smith Foundation, (donated $100)


### Goal for next tutoring session
None so far

### Notes for 21st of April
Seems mighty competent for needing math tutoring, but remain humble and curious!

$$ a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) $$

Pretty darn good with graphs and translations, odd and even graphs, applications
to cubics (box question) needed a bit of guidance.

$$ x^2-x^2 = x^2 - x^2 $$

Don't divide by 0.

Overall, had not enough to talk about this session! Remain curious.

### Notes for the 28th of April
I am a limited resource! It's good to not go over new things with me but to rather
come to me with questions that you have after trying to go through it yourself.

Always keep in mind what is reasonable when checking solutions. This can both
be important in checking for errors and throwing out solutions that are not
valid for your current problem.

All in all, very impressed with your progress. Keep it up!

### Notes for the 12th of May
Good job with these matricies! Matricies are usually one of the topics for which
people need a small push on but once they have got the skill they have the skill.
So I have faith you'll do well.

I have not much notes to make here. If you want to learn more about matricies, I
can't recommend any resource better than trying them out in your textbook and 
giving me questions that you've got.

Keep up the good work!

## Notes for 26th of May
Logarithms!!!

Remember not to confuse logarithms with roots, they are quite different things.
But I think you shouldn't find that too difficult.

I'm going to put a few interesting rules for logs here, and how they correlate
with exponential rules you should be familiar with:

- $$\log_a b + \log_a c = log_a (b \times c)$$ is the same idea as $$a^(b+c) = a^b \times a^c$$
- $$\log_a b - \log_a c = log_a (\frac{b}{c})$$ is the same idea as $$a^(b-c) = \frac{a^b}{a^c}$$
- $$\log_a b^c = c \cdot \log_a b$$ is the same idea is $$(a^b)^c = a^(b\cdot c)$$

There are a couple more useful laws, but these are the main ones.

I honestly don't think you really need much help with logs, I'm sure you are doing
well on your own. Keep up the good work!
