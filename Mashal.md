### Notes for 2nd of March
I am very impressed with your ability to pick up knowledge so quickly! Most of 
the things we went over were simply things that were not covered by the teacher,
so you are doing very well.

Things we covered:

- Long Division
- Synthetic Division
- Difference/Sum of Cubes

When I was learning these things, factorizing higher order polynomials was one 
of the most painful things to learn. There are quite a few strategies you have
to keep in mind for different cases.

To take the examples we did in class:

$$ (x^2 + x + 3)(x^2 + x + 4) - 12 $$

$$ x^4 + x^3 + 4x^2 + x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 3x^2 + 3x + 12 - 12 $$

$$ x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 7x $$

$$ x(x^3 + 2x^2 + 8x + 7) $$

Now here's the part that no one really likes, we have to find _a_ solution for
the cubic on the right. We can only do this by guessing! But our guesses can be
informed by the [rational root theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem).

The definition on the wikipedia page of this is very precise. But basically, after
as much simplification has been done (like when we factored out the $$x$$) the
root must be $$\frac{p}{q}$$, where $$p$$ is a factor of the last coefficient (7) and
$$q$$ is a factor of the leading coefficient (1 in this case). Because the leading
coefficient is 1, which only really has the factor 1. Our case is, as I said, 
factors of the last term.

These factors can be positive or negative, so we must test $$-1$$, $$1$$, $$-7$$ and $$7$$.
Thankfully, on our second try, $$-1$$ seems to fit the bill.

$$ (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 8(-1) + 7 $$

$$ -1 + 2 - 8 + 7 $$

$$ 0 $$

This means that $$-1$$ is a _solution_ and $$(x + 1)$$ is a _factor_. So, we both did
full [polynomial division](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:poly-div/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:quad-div-by-linear/v/polynomial-division) and [synthetic division](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-polynomials/alg-synthetic-division-of-polynomials/v/synthetic-division) (Khan academy is amazing, should help you if you are confused)

If we divide them, we are left with $$x^2 + x + 7$$. So that means the factorized form is:

$$ x(x + 1)(x^2 + x + 7) $$

We did a couple more examples of this.

Finally, [difference and sum of perfect cubes](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/specfact2.htm) is very simply a matter of identification
and remembering the formulas. I despise remembering things in math! I prefer
everything to be 'intuitive'. You can pretty easily verify these, but it would
honestly be simpler to remember.

$$ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2+ab+b^2) $$

$$ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2-ab+b^2) $$

Keep an eye out for when this can be applied, you might not see a cube sign!

For instance, our example:

$$ x^6 - 8 $$

has no cube but $$x^2 = a$$ and $$2 = b$$ fit the bill.

Another one to watch out for is expressions, such as

$$ (x + 2)^3 - 27  $$

$$x + 2 = a$$ and $$3 = b$$ work, but mean you might have to simplify later down
the track.

If you have any questions throughout the week, feel free to email me! I don't
charge extra for that. 

### Notes for 9th of March
Looking into fractions! You're doing a very good job.

Remember, _we can never divide by 0_. If you want the working out for the problem
I showed you so that you can show it to your friends, here it is:

$$ x^2 - x^2 = x^2 - x^2 $$
$$ x(x-x) = (x+x)(x-x) $$
$$ x = (x + x) $$
$$ x = 2x $$
$$ 1 = 2 $$

This is why $$\frac{a}{0}$$ is always undefined, even if $$a$$ is also 0!

When $$a \neq 0$$, $$\frac{0}{a} = 0$$.

But in the end, working with fractions is just an extension of your algebreic
knowledge! Such as:

$$ \frac{a}{b} = c  $$

$$ a = bc $$

This method helps turn fractions into multiplications, which is very useful.

Simplifying fractions is a process of removing things that are on both the top
and the bottom, just like factorizing!

Nevertheless, I don't think you really need this, you are doing a fantastic job.
