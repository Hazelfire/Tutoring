### Notes from the 30th of April
Can you get my depth of wells question?

[Here is some really formal stuff on domains on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function).

It might be a bit pure, but if you can wrap your head around it, you are primed
to have a very strong understanding of what a domain is.

You seem to be pretty good at inverse functions. Good job!

I can't think of many good explanations of piecewise functions that would be
better than you looking at examples and websites on your own. Good luck!

### Notes from the 7th of May
Good to hear that your SAC went well!

Doing really well!
