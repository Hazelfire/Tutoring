### Notes from the 30th of April
Can you get my depth of wells question?

[Here is some really formal stuff on domains on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function).

It might be a bit pure, but if you can wrap your head around it, you are primed
to have a very strong understanding of what a domain is.

You seem to be pretty good at inverse functions. Good job!

I can't think of many good explanations of piecewise functions that would be
better than you looking at examples and websites on your own. Good luck!

### Notes from the 7th of May
Good to hear that your SAC went well!

Doing really well!

### Notes from the 21st of May
Excited to get back to school.

Doing very well with constructing polynomials. Although you don't seem to be
making this mistake, I'll warn you about this common pitfall.

How many points make a cubic? 4 points. You'll find that most of the time you will
be getting 4 points when looking at cubics.

This corresponds to the 4 variables you have to solve for in:

$$y = a(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)$$

You need 3 points for polynomials, 5 for quartics etc. Remember this and make
sure you're not forgeting a variable (the $$a$$ at the start of this equation is
often forgoting)

Synthetic division! Google it, it's a fantastic tool.

### Notes from 28th of May
Good luck for your SAC next Tuesday!

Functions are great use in math and in your casio calculator! There's a little
bit of terminology with functions that sometimes get mixed up because math
functions and computer functions (like the ones on your TI-Nspire) are usually 
two almost the same but slightly different things.

There are many functions on your TI-Nspire! And you can define more of them if you
want. In fact I would highly reccomend it.

Just be careful with variables (which includes functions) that you haven't cleared yet
messing up future problems. If you define $$x$$ to be 3, then any time you use $$x$$
it will be considered as 3 in your CAS. This is a massive issue and has caused
many issues if you're not wary of it.
