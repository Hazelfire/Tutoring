### Notes from 22nd of April 2020
Awesome, so **remember** there are **3** methods for integrating a polynomial
divided by another polynomial

1. **If the numerator is the derivative of the denominator** (the function is of the
   form $$\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$) then the integral is $$\ln{|f(x)|}$$
2. **If the denominator is factorisable** Factorise it and use partial fractions
3. **If the denominator is not factorisable** Use inverse tan

### Notes from 8th of May 2020
I remember things by understanding things. It's not that difficult... Everything
sort of fits in with the rest of my world and is very practical. Ask why more
often and you might have fun going down rabbit holes.

I once saw a talk that said math was all about asking deep questions about simple
things. I agree with this, the entire field of science is all about asking really
detailed questions and always remaining curious.

### Notes from the 13th of May
Linear interpolation!

Interpolation is taking two values and moving between the two. Often to estimate
different values. It's often used in line charts! Because line charts only make
a finite amount of observations, so to connect the two dots would be to interpolate
between those two points.

Linear interpolation (lerp) can apply to normal numbers as well as vectors. To lerp
between 2 and 6 with a value of 0.25 would be 3.

To lerp between $$a$$ and $$b$$ by a factor $$c$$

$$lerp(a,b,c) = (1-c)a + cb$$

This is particularly useful for finding a point between two points by a particular
factor. The formula might look a bit difficult, but it isn't really, it's like
mixing the two values in different quantities. 70% this 30% that.

Remember the formula's for vector resolutes and scalar resolutes! This is just
something burned into my memory. This particular formula comes to mind:

$$v(a,b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{b \cdot b} \cdot b$$

Always check your types! Like integration, types here are important and you need
to make sure you understand them and use them to validate your answers. Types will save
your ass, gauranteed.

The above function is a vector, because the fraction evaluates to a scalar, and
a scalar multiplied by a vector is a vector. So therefore remove the unit vector
part of it to get to the scalar

$$s(a,b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{|b|}$$

### Notes from the 20th of May 2020

**REMEMBER!** Don't divide by 0!

Feel free to divide out a value that has x in it, but **ALWAYS** check whether
if that value was 0 there might have been a solution.

Related rates are difficult at first, but they get fun and also help you reason
about types and the more advanced integration (that I hope that you get to do,
but I'm not sure now that you have COVID). The concept is not that difficult if
you can just remember all the types that you should obey, and that when you integrate,
you always check that the variable you are integrating is on the bottom line.

With fancy trig relations, often going back to just sin and cos helps out a lot.
Furthermore, with any relation, getting rid of fractions is always a good idea.
Fractions is pretty high on the things I dislike when it comes to solving equations.

I might update this list, and it's pretty primative, but honestly:

Things Sam dislikes when solving trig equations:
1. Fractions
2. different multiples of x inside trig functions $$\sin{8x}$$ and $$\cos{4x}$$ in the same equation
3. more than just sin and cos in an equation
4. More than 1 sin/cos function

Getting rid of these things can help you solve these types of equations.

### Notes for the 27th of May 2020
Good luck for the Sac next Tuesday!

Quartics require 5 peices of information to construct. Points are one piece of
informaion, but gradients can be another as I showed you in this lesson. Using
gradients.

You should be able to work with $$\cos^{-1}$$ by now! Telling me the graph immediately!
This is important, remember what the shapes and domains of all these graphs.
I don't actually remember the shapes of these graphs, I just know what they are
and therefore can derive what their shape is. When I was looking to graph this.
I thought, $$\cos$$ of what equals 0? well $$\frac{\pi}{2}$$. so it goes through
that point $$(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$$ and so on.

Please send me questions you have.
