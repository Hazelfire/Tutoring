Up to Integration by parts and linear substitution

### Goal for next tutoring session
Be able to integrate any (1/f(x)) where f(x) is a polynomial (Not just quadratics!).

Done 1 math exam

### Notes from 22nd of April 2020
Awesome, so **remember** there are **3** methods for integrating a polynomial
divided by another polynomial

1. **If the numerator is a multiple of the denominator** (the function is of the
   form a(f'(x) / f(x))) then the integral is a * ln(f(x))
2. **If the denominator is factorisable** Factorise it and use partial fractions
3. **If the denominator is not factorisable** Use inverse tan
