Up to Integration by parts and linear substitution

### Goal for next tutoring session
Be able to integrate any $$\frac{1}{f(x)}$$ where $$f(x)$$ is a polynomial (Not just quadratics!).

Done 1 math exam

### Notes from 22nd of April 2020
Awesome, so **remember** there are **3** methods for integrating a polynomial
divided by another polynomial

1. **If the numerator is the derivative of the denominator** (the function is of the
   form $$\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$) then the integral is $$\ln{|f(x)|}$$
2. **If the denominator is factorisable** Factorise it and use partial fractions
3. **If the denominator is not factorisable** Use inverse tan

### Notes from 8th of May 2020
I remember things by understanding things. It's not that difficult... Everything
sort of fits in with the rest of my world and is very practical. Ask why more
often and you might have fun going down rabbit holes.

I once saw a talk that said math was all about asking deep questions about simple
things. I agree with this, the entire field of science is all about asking really
detailed questions and always remaining curious.
