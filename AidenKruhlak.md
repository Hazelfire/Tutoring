### Notes for 21st of April

Seems like we had a lot to talk about!

Here are a couple of useful links

 - [Parabola Transformations](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gh5du3k4mp)
 - [Parabola Forms](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z1tvbo5cew)
 - [Synthetic Division](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/synthdiv.htm)

Friday your Turtle assignment is due!

My advice would be to say if you don't find it interesting and fun, you might
be looking at the problem wrong. Feel free to send me messages and we can
talk through other problems!

### Notes for the 28th of April

Looking mainly through your test results.

Do not forget the $$a$$ in $$a(x-b)(x-c)$$

To find the the vertex of a parabola, use $$\frac{-b}/{2a}$$

Show questions do not allow you to use the solution that is given, you must derive
the solution. However, if you can't get a show question, use the answer to solve
the following questions.

Length of lines can be done with pythagoras $$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
