Next tutoring session: 21st of May 5:00pm - 6:00pm

Charity: The Hunger Project Australia, (donated $140)

Up to factorising cubics with long division

### Goal for next tutoring session
Goal to complete up to 4A.

### Notes for 21st of April

Seems like we had a lot to talk about!

Here are a couple of useful links

 - [Parabola Transformations](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gh5du3k4mp)
 - [Parabola Forms](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/z1tvbo5cew)
 - [Synthetic Division](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/synthdiv.htm)

Friday your Turtle assignment is due!

My advice would be to say if you don't find it interesting and fun, you might
be looking at the problem wrong. Feel free to send me messages and we can
talk through other problems!

### Notes for the 28th of April

Looking mainly through your test results.

Do not forget the $$a$$ in $$a(x-b)(x-c)$$

To find the the vertex of a parabola, use $$\frac{-b}{2a}$$

Show questions do not allow you to use the solution that is given, you must derive
the solution. However, if you can't get a show question, use the answer to solve
the following questions.

Length of lines can be done with pythagoras $$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

To determine intersections, simply equate one equation with the other. Intersections
often are when one function will become larger than the other or vice versa.

Make sure you come to me with good questions! I am a limited resource, so first
have a go at the work that you have been allocated then bring it to me.

### Notes for the 7th and 14th of May
Congratulations on your test results!

You're getting pretty good at transformations. Just remember, with $$f(x-h)+c$$
is translated up c and to the right by h. Sometimes you do get the two mixed up.

Sometimes I think that your are less confident about your answers than you should
be. Be proud of your mistakes! They are definitely your greatest teachers. I
really enjoy making mistakes and being wrong about things, because there's nothing
that will make you understand a concept better than to be wrong about it.

Just for reference:

$$\frac{a}{\frac{b}{c}} = \frac{a}{\frac{b}{c}} \cdot \frac{c}{c} = \frac{ac}{b}$$

If you ever want to model anything. You first get the general form (like $$y=mx+c$$
for lines) then substitute in points. That's the process no matter what you are modelling.
